    <h3> Why I Love The Walking Dead</h3>
    <p> The Walking Dead is my TV show because it's very exciting and it always calls your attention so much that you become addicted to it. According to the ratings, it is the highest rated TV show on air right now. Right now, the show is on a break and it left off on a cliffhanger that has left many fans anxious for the continuation of the show. I don't have cable, so I watch it through Netflix and I'm currently waiting for season 6. Season 7 premiers on October and I can't wait to watch it.... on Netflix.</p>
<h3> What The Walking Dead Is About </h3>
<p> The Walking Dead takes places in Atlanta, Georgia. The show revolves around Rick Grimes(8th on to the left), a sheriff who wakes up in the middle of the apocalypse inside a hospital after getting shot on duty. He then tries to find his family and finds them with a group of survivors. The group tries to find a place to settle down and call home. The problem is either the walkers(zombies) or another rival group led by an evil person like <a href="http://images.amcnetworks.com/amc.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/AMC_TWD_S4_408_TributeToTheGovernor_NewYears.jpg"> The Governor.</a> Right now, the threat of the group is <a href="http://static.srcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/Jeffrey-Dean-Morgan-as-Negan-in-The-Walking-Dead-Season-6-Episode-16.jpg"> Negan.</a></p>
