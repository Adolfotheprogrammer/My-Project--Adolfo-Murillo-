    <h3> Why I Love The Walking Dead</h3>
    <p> The Walking Dead is my TV show because it's very exciting and it always calls your attention so much that you become addicted to it. According to the ratings, it is the highest rated TV show on air right now. Right now, the show is on a break and it left off on a cliffhanger that has left many fans anxious for the continuation of the show. Season 7 premiers on October and I can't wait.
