<h1> What I expect of The Walking Dead in the Future</h1>
<p> There are many things that I expect from Season 7 of The Walking Dead. First, is that they keep the same level of hype that the show currently has. Another thing is that they don't kill one of the good characters (basically my favorite characters). A lot of of people hated the Season 6 cliffhanger, but personally I liked the decision that the creators took. It adds excitement and makes the viewers anxious to find out what's going to happen next.</p>
<p> I can't wait until Season 7 of The Walking Dead comes to Netflix. Sadly, I have to wait a whole year for that. Good thing Season 6 comes out on Thursday. I'm so excited to see what is going to happen next because I want to catch up to the lastest events. That is all I have to talk about<a href="http://www.amc.com/shows/the-walking-dead"> The Walking Dead.</a></p>
